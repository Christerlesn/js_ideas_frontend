#RandomIdeaGenerator
This is a Rails/Javascript project completed to meet Flatiron project requirements, in the process of becoming a software engineer.

##Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```javascript
gem 'js_ideas_frontend'
```

And for the Backend
```ruby on rails
gem 'js_ideas_backend'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
    Frontend:
    $ gem install js_ideas_frontend
    Backend:
    $ gem install js_ideas_backend

## For Backend

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
